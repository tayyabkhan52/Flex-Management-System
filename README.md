*Project Title:* Flex Management System

*Description:*
I led the development of a comprehensive university management system, "Flex Management System," as part of a semester project. This console-based C++ implementation showcases strong object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and sophisticated file handling. This was a semester project and was graded at the end of submission as well. 

**Key Features:**
- **OOP Design:** Utilized robust OOP principles for a structured and maintainable codebase.
- **File Handling:** Managed complex file structures for student records, teacher records, attendance, marks, and grades.
- **Data Extraction:** Extracted and processed data from text files, ensuring accuracy and efficiency.
- **Console Interface:** Designed a user-friendly console interface for seamless system interaction.

Despite its console-based nature, the "Flex Management System" offers a powerful tool for university management and data analysis. For collaboration or further insights, please don't hesitate to connect with me.

You are free to improve it as you want. Please do give credits if it is being used since I do not authenticate you to use this and copy all the code. you can use it  for educational purposes
